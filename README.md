Project on hospitalization costs

It has been so far a very interesting learning experience to work on this project. Here, we were tasked to combine three different datasets: 
1. Census dataset
2. Geographical dataset with the zipcodes for various hospitals
3. Hospital information including the DRG codes

The objective was to study the patterns among the hospitals across the country with respect to costs to the medicare patients for the Pneumonia and AMI(Acute Myocardial Infarction). After combining the three datasets we realized we need to reduce the number of features to make the dataset viable to run various models on them.

In this project, we tried various methods until we came to a satisfactory result. I have uploaded all the files related to this project including the codes that we did not end up using in the final file. I believe it is always imperative to learn how an individual arrived at a certain conclusion. Hence, here you'll discover everything related to the project, including the mistakes (important steps towards success)! 

Hope you find it useful!
